### BRICS&#x20;

**The BRICS countries**

Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africaâ€”have each developed distinct data protection frameworks in recent years, reflecting their commitment to safeguarding personal data and aligning with international standards. Brazil:\*\*

TheD establishes principles such as purpose limitation, data minimization, and transparency, and grants individuals rights including access, correction, and deletion of their data. The Nnal Data Protection Authority (ANPD) oversees compliance and enforcement. ([cyberics.info](https://cerbrics.info/da-protection-across-brics-countries/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Russia:**

Russia's data protection is governed by the Fel Law on Personal Data (No. 152-FZ), enacted in 2006 and amended in 2015. The law requires that peal data of Russian citizens be stored and processed within the country. The Roskomnadzor (Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Informatn Technology, and Ms Media) is rponsible for monitoring compliance.

### BRICS&#x20;

**The BRICS countries**

Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa—have each developed distinct data protection frameworks in recent years, reflecting their commitment to safeguarding personal data and aligning with international standards. Brazil:\*\*

Bral enacted the General Data Protection Law (LGPD) in 2018, which regulates the collection, use, and processing of personal data. TheD establishes principles such as purpose limitation, data minimization, and transparency, and grants individuals rights including access, correction, and deletion of their data. The Nnal Data Protection Authority (ANPD) oversees compliance and enforcement. ([cyberics.info](https://cerbrics.info/da-protection-across-brics-countries/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Russia:**

Russia's data protection is governed by the Fel Law on Personal Data (No. 152-FZ), enacted in 2006 and amended in 2015. The law requires that peal data of Russian citizens be stored and processed within the country. The Roskomnadzor (Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Informatn Technology, and Ms Media) is rponsible for monitoring compliance. ([cyberbrinfo](https://cyberbrics.info/data-protection-across-brics-countries/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**India:**

([cyberbrics.info](https://cybics.info/data-protection-across-brics-countries/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**China:**

China's data protection is primarily governed by the Cybersecurity Law,ective since 2017, which includes provisions on personal data proction. In 2021, Chi enacted the PersonaInformation Protection Law (PIPL), which strengthens individual rights and imposes stricter obligations on data processors. The Cyberspacministration of China (CAC) oversees enforcement. ([cyberbrics.info](https://cyberbrics.in/data-protection-acsbrics-countries/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

The Information Regulator is responsible for monitoring compliance and handlinmplaints. ([cyberbrics.info](https://cyberbrics.info/data-protection-across-brics-countries/?utm_source=chatgpt.co)

While each BRICSotry has developed its own data protection framework, there is a noticeable trend toward convergence and legal interoperability. Th alignment is evide in the adoption of similar principles and the establishment of regulatory bodies to enforce compliance. Such convergence facilitates international cooperation and enhances the protection of personal data across borders.

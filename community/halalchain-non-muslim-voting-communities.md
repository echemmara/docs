# HalalChain Non-Muslim Voting Communities

***

## Introduction

With **72% of halal certifications** held by **non-Muslim companies in Malaysia**, their role in the halal economy is undeniable. However, decision-making and governance regarding halal standards are often centralized within Muslim-majority institutions. **HalalChain** seeks to create an **inclusive, blockchain-powered voting system** that allows **non-Muslim businesses and stakeholders** to actively participate in halal compliance discussions, fostering transparency and mutual trust.

**Key Challenges for Non-Muslim Stakeholders in Halal Governance**

2. **Trust Deficit** â€“ Many Muslim consumers question the authenticity of non-Muslim-owned halal-certified businesses due to lack of direct engagement in halal governance.
3. **Inconsistent Standards** â€“ Different halal authorities impose varying standards, creating difficulties for non-Muslim companies operating globally.
4. **Lack of Transparent Voting Mechanisms** â€“ Current halal certification and governance frameworks lack decentralized, transparent voting systems.

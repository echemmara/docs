## A **HalalChain Voting Communities (HVCs): Blockchain-Powered Governance & Tokenomics**

### **Introduction**

The halal industry is rapidly expanding, with **72% of halal-certified businesses owned by non-Muslim companies**. Ensuring compliance, trust, and fairness in governance requires **a decentralized, transparent voting system** that represents **Muslim scholars, halal businesses, regulators, and consumers**.

**HalalChain Voting Communities (HVCs)** operate on **blockchain-based decentralized governance**, where **weighted voting, smart contracts, and** 💲**MyHalal token staking** enable fair decision-making in halal policy and business operations.&#x20;

This document integrates **real-world case studies and tokenomics models** into the HalalChain Voting Communities framework.

### **Tokenomics Integration in HalalChain Voting Communities**

#### **1.** 💲**MyHalal Token Utility**

The 💲**MyHalal** token is the **native digital asset** of HalalChain, enabling:\
✅ **Voting Rights** – Token holders can **participate in governance proposals**.\
✅ **Staking Mechanism** – Users stake tokens to **gain voting power & rewards**.\
✅ **Transaction Medium** – Used for **payments, smart contracts, and halal audits**.\
✅ **Rewards & Incentives** – **Consumers, businesses, and scholars earn tokens** for participation.

#### **2. Weighted Voting Model**

Voting power is **distributed based on token holdings and roles**:\
🔹 **Muslim Scholars & Certifiers** – 35% (Higher weight for religious compliance)\
🔹 **Muslim-Owned Halal Businesses** – 25% (Prioritizing SMEs & halal integrity)\
🔹 **Non-Muslim Halal Companies** – 25% (Supply chain, logistics, and investments)\
🔹 **Consumers & Public** – 10% (Fraud prevention & market transparency)\
🔹 **Technology & Compliance Experts** – 5% (Blockchain security & AI verification)

💡 **Use Case:** A **halal SME from Indonesia stakes** 💲**MyHalal tokens** to propose a **new halal certification process for micro-businesses**. The DAO votes, and **if approved, the SME receives funding from the HalalChain grant pool.**

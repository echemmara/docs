#### **Additional Notes on Roadmap Architecture**:

* **Blockchain Choice**: Selecting the right blockchain (Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, etc.) is crucial for scalability, transaction speed, and low gas fees.
* **Sharia Compliance**: Consistent audits by Sharia boards and compliance with Islamic finance principles are essential at every stage.
* **User-Centric Design**: Ensure that the platform is designed with the user in mind, making it simple for non-tech-savvy users to navigate.

# Disadvantages of Decentralization

***



_**Disadvantages of Centralization:**_

* _Lack of Flexibility:_ Centralized systems may be slow to adapt to change, as decisions are made by a small group, often unaware of the specific needs or desires of the broader population.
* _Risk of Abuse of Power:_ A concentrated authority may act in its own self-interest, which can lead to inequality and corruption.
* _Limited Participation:_ The broader community or stakeholders have little or no say in decision-making processes.

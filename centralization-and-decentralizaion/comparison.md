| _Aspect_                  | _Centralization_                                | _Decentralization_                                               |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _Power Distribution_      | Power is concentrated in one central authority. | Power is spread across multiple entities.                        |
| _Decision-Making Process_ | Top-down approach, decisions made by few.       | Bottom-up approach, decisions made collaboratively.              |
| _Efficiency_              | Generally quicker decision-making.              | Slower, due to need for consensus.                               |
| _Flexibility_             | Less adaptable to changes or innovation.        | More flexible and adaptive to new needs.                         |
| _Transparency_            | Can be opaque, with decisions often hidden.     | High transparency, especially in public systems like blockchain. |
| _Risk of Abuse_           | High risk of corruption or misuse of power.     | Lower risk due to distributed power and accountability.          |
| _Participation_           | Limited, only those in power have a say.        | High, everyone can participate in decision-making.               |

2. **Color Palette**: Green (symbolizing Islam and growth), gold (wealth), and blockchain tech accents (e.g., Ethereum’s purple, Bitcoin orange).
3. **Trust & Compliance**: Include Halal certification badges or "Sharia-compliant" labels.

**Example of Tokenization Process:**

Assuming **$MyHalal** is initially priced at 0.01 USD per token in the public sale, the price can fluctuate based on market conditions:

| **Token Pair**     | **Price Example**          |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| **$MyHalal/USDT**  | 1 $MyHalal = 0.01 USD      |
| **$MyHalal/ETH**   | 1 $MyHalal = 0.000003 ETH  |
| **$MyHalal/MATIC** | 1 $MyHalal = 0.00015 MATIC |

These prices are hypothetical and will change as the market evolves.

***

**Token Use in the HalalChain Ecosystem:**

* **Staking Rewards:** Users who stake **$MyHalal** tokens will earn rewards that may be paid in **$MyHalal** or other designated cryptocurrencies based on staking pools.
* **Payments:** **$MyHalal** can be used to pay for products and services on the HalalChain Marketplace, with the transaction value determined by the current market rate.
* **Governance Participation:** Token holders will use **$MyHalal** tokens to vote on key platform decisions, influencing the future development of HalalChain Marketplace.

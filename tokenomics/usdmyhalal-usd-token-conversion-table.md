**1. Token Conversion Rates**

* **USD/Coins:**\
  The value of **$MyHalal** tokens in USD will be determined through market demand, exchanges, and supply dynamics. While HalalChain will not directly peg $MyHalal to any specific fiat currency (such as USD), the **market price** will fluctuate based on supply and demand.
  * The initial token sale price will be determined through the **Public Sale** or **Initial Coin Offering (ICO)** phase.
  * Once the token is listed on exchanges, the price will be governed by trading pairs such as **$MyHalal/USDT**, **$MyHalal/USD**, or **$MyHalal/ETH**, allowing users to purchase and trade the token in USD or Ethereum.
* **Ethereum and Polygon Integration:**
  * **Ethereum (ETH):** Since the token is built on both Ethereum and Polygon, **ETH** will be one of the major base pairs for trading and liquidity purposes. This provides liquidity and depth in decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap or Sushiswap on the Ethereum network.
  * **Polygon (MATIC):** **$MyHalal** can also be traded with **Polygon's native MATIC token**, enabling cheaper transaction fees and faster confirmations compared to Ethereum-based transactions.
